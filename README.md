# Fourier Series JavaScript - v1.0.0

## Introdution
This project has the goal of draw things using a mathematic tool called 
[Complex Fourier Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series) 
by JavaScript. The program is easy and simple to use.  

## How it works?
The heart of the program is based on this formula. With it, 
we can define the coefficients of all circles and make possible
draw just using the sum of all circles.

To calculate the integral, an approximation 
is used so that it is possible to define the coefficients.
